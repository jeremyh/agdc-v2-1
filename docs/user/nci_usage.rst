NCI Usage Guide
===============

.. note::
    These instructions are only relevant to using the :term:`AGDC` on the :term:`NCI` in Australia.

    For details on accessing the NCI, see http://nci.org.au/.

    For details on accessing the :term:`VDI` at NCI, see http://vdi.nci.org.au/help.

To use the AGCD modules on ``raijin`` or ``VDI``, add the datacube module path::

    $ module use /g/data/v10/public/modules/modulefiles/

(you can add the above to your ``.bash_profile`` to avoid running it every time)

There
You should now have access to the following modules:

 * **agdc-py2-prod** - Python 2.7
 * **agdc-py3-prod** - Python 3.5

To load the production module with Python 3, run::

    $ module load agdc-py3-prod

The first time you load the module, it will register your account with the datacube, granting you read-only access.

It will store your password in the file `~/.pgpass`.

.. note::
    VDI and Raijin have separate home directories, so you must copy your pgpass to the other if
    you use both environments.

    You can push the contents of your pgpass file from VDI to raijin by running on a terminal window in VDI::

        remote-hpc-cmd init
        ssh raijin "cat >> ~/.pgpass" < ~/.pgpass
        ssh raijin "chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass"


    You will most likely be prompted for your NCI password.

    To pull the contents of your pgpass from Raijin to VDI, run ::

        ssh raijin "cat ~/.pgpass" >> ~/.pgpass
        chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass

.. warning::
    If you have created a ``.datacube.conf`` file in your home folder from early Data Cube betas, you should rename or remove it
    to avoid it conflicting with the settings loaded by the module.
